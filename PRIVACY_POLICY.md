# Privacy Policy

## Overview

This extension does not collect, store, track, or share personal user data. All functionality runs locally in the user's browser unless an optional feature is explicitly enabled.

## Information Collection

The extension does **not** collect any personal information, browsing history, usage analytics, identifiers, or tracking data.

No accounts are created and no data is stored on external servers by the extension.

## Local Storage

The extension uses browser storage APIs solely to save user preferences and settings, such as customization options for the new tab page. This data remains local to the user's device and is never transmitted externally.

If users upload wallpapers, they are stored locally in the browser. No uploaded files are sent off the device.

## Bookmarks Access

The extension reads the user's bookmarks only to display them on the new tab page. Bookmark data is not collected, transmitted, or shared.

Favicons may be loaded to visually represent bookmarks. These are retrieved directly from the corresponding websites by the browser.

## Optional Search Suggestions

The extension includes an **optional** feature that provides live search suggestions as the user types.

When this feature is enabled:

- The current search query is sent directly from the user's browser to DuckDuckGo's public autocomplete suggestions API
- Requests do not include cookies, user accounts, extension identifiers, or other personal data
- Suggestions are not based on the user's personal search history

This feature is disabled by default and can be turned off at any time.

## Third-Party Services

The only third-party service used is DuckDuckGo's public autocomplete suggestions API, and only when the optional search suggestions feature is enabled.

No other third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools are used.

## Data Sharing

The extension does not sell, share, or transfer user data to third parties.

## Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated if the extension's functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected in the published policy.

If you have questions about this privacy policy, you may contact the developer through contact@maxhu.dev
